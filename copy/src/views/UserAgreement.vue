</li>
<li>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The proper tax reporting forms and legal entity information must be on file at MiV. Such distribution thus can occur only if registered/winning artists have on file a legal 1099, or W 9 document tax (example for entities of the United</span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> States) or </span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Country of origin form.

</li>
<li>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Only the Live section qualifies for financial payout. The Live section payout is for all Live (8) genre competition artists based on the in-genre final ranking plus the qualified copyright holders of their music. The overall financial sum available for the 8 Live section genres is a percentage of the member Subscriber monthly net revenue (after credit card charges). Each Live genre may receive an equal share of the total artist fund. </span></span></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">One of the Main MiV goals is to be a platform that can provide meaningful financial opportunities for Independent Artists. The Series 1 and Series 2, which approximates 12 months; the payout schedule would provide up to $15 million US. This is based on a </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>monthly</u></span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"> Member subscriber base of 2 million paying Members at $3.99 for a full 13 months. The payout sum is for the Live Contestants for 2 Series, over approximately 13 months and is the sum to be divided among the 8 genres in the Live section (only). Please note, as stated, the total artist payout is based on 2 Million Members fully subscribed for each of the 13 months. For example, if in the first three months the number of Members is only 300,000 total then the average monthly Members could be lower than the 2 million average thus lowering the payout available. Conversely, if the subscribing members increase, then, of course, the payout would be proportionately higher. If the user base for Series 2 is higher than Series 1 then the total payout for Series 2 would be higher. Each Series is computed as a discreet event. </span></span></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> <span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Once we have history we can publish actual payout totals and individual slotted payout for artists. There is no fee or cost to artists for signing up. Each month a percentage of net revenue less credit card costs is applied and paid to the MiV Artist Bank Account before any other costs, expenses, salaries or fees are taken. MiV has no debt or finance costs. </span></span></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">It is the sole discretion of MiV as to the rules for the Competition and the financial formula for total payout and individual payout based on final ranking. MiV also reserves the right to adjust the payout between genres if in MiV&rsquo;s opinion market conditions and fan participant so warrants adjustments. Any changes to payout formulas can be made but only after a Series is completed. </span></span></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> <span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">MiV may, at its sole discretion, make adjustments to total money paid to a Genre based on subscribing members of that genre compared to the number of subscribing members for the other genres. Only the Member/subscribers can vote and as such determine Series (Live Contest/Tournament) outcomes and rankings. Note, MiV does not vote or use MiV judges to vote to determine contest results. The Member /subscribers represent 100% of Artist voting (and thus financial payout). However, if you have broken a MiV policy, such as using unauthorized music, or broken other policies then at MiV&rsquo;s sole discretion MiV may cancel you from the contest and any subsequent financial payout for that Series.</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">There are two Artist Competition Sections; Live and Draft</span></span></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">There are 8 Genres, and 240 artists total </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>in each genre</u></span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"> in Live and Draft. </span></span></span></p>

</li>
<li>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">In the first Competition, Artists are seeded in Live and Draft based on their total number of Fan Following. The lowest seeded Artist in Live is higher than the top seeded artist in Draft. Seeding is 100% decided by Fan following. </span></span></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The difference for Live is that artists earn pay-out based on competition results. Draft is for Artists gaining traction and building Fan Following. The Draft Artist goal is to place high in their genre competition and possibly be seeded to the Live Section Competition. All Competition Results are decided 100% by </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Member</u></span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"> Fan Voting.
